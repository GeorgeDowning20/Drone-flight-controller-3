# Drone-flight-controller-3

Third attempt at writing a drone flight controller:
This implementaion incudes stabiliseation mode and a lose altitude hold implementation. 
The inertial estimation algorythm needs improving for better altitude hold

Hardware: 
MATEK FC with stm32 F7 MPU6250.
Spedix 35a 4 in one esc, using multishot for really fast updates
2204 motors swinging 3 inch props (terible combination, but what was avalable plus I like my fingers the way they are)
ibus serial rc link (flysky)
Frame CNCd carbon fibre frame, with 3d printed wither bits and bobs eg.. electronics mounts and prop gaurds,
4s lipo (220mah)
Serail radio for debugging
MATEK optical flow and lidar.

This was one of my first programming projects hence is written very poorly, however is a really cool feat of engineering for a hobbyist, and contains some awsome algorthms
